Vulnerability occurs if you use CookieJar in rejectPublicSuffixes=false mode.
You can do Prototype Pollution when pass Domain=__proto__

Prevent prototype pollution in cookie memstore
memstore.js file:
Changed all occurrences of idx initializations from {} to Object.create(null) 

parser.json file:
Removed deprecated unit tests [0002, COMMA0006, COMMA0007]

For tests check command `npm run test`

After Implementing the Fix for the Vulnerability - run those commands:
Before packing first run the index.js file:
npm install tough-cookie@2.5.0 && node index.js

After viewing the results you may pack the current tough-cookie-2.5.0 refactored by me:
rm -rf node_modules
npm run pack-patched
npm install ./tough-cookie-2.5.0-PATCHED.tgz && node index.js

command in order to pack:
npm pack
ORIGINAL_FILE=$(ls *.tgz) # Finds the generated .tgz file
PATCHED_FILE=$(echo $ORIGINAL_FILE | sed 's/\.tgz$/-PATCHED.tgz/') # Appends "-PATCHED"
mv "$ORIGINAL_FILE" "$PATCHED_FILE"
echo "Packed file renamed to $PATCHED_FILE"

or running script command:
npm run pack-patched
after adding this line to scripts section in package.json file:
"pack-patched": "npm pack && mv $(ls *.tgz) $(ls *.tgz | sed 's/\\.tgz$/-PATCHED.tgz/')"
